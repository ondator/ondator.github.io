<img src="/assets/img/sample/about.jpg" alt="about" class="left"> Hi there! My name is Vitaly and I'm system architect with more than 10 years experience. This blog consists of some notes I use by myself and I hope will be useful to others.
However my main experience related to Microsoft stack (.Net, Azure, Sql Server, etc) I often use other technologies such as Scala, NodeJs, Ruby, etc and work on different viewpoints(data, operations, software development, management and even product)
Please take a look! I'll be happy if you'll find something interesting here. You can also find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/overtimehate) and [github](https://github.com/ondator)
